# KuanHsiaokuo's Developer Space

## Welcome!

Greetings and welcome to **KuanHsiaokuo's Developer Space**! I'm known online as **KuanHsiaokuo**, a name deeply
meaningful to me, inspired by the profound wisdom of _The Book of Changes (I Ching)_.

Here, you will find a collection of my knowledge and insights into programming, spanning across multiple languages and
technologies including Python, Rust, Go, TypeScript, and Shell scripting. This space is dedicated to sharing my thoughts
on programming and is intended to be a resource for developers, tech enthusiasts, and recruiters interested in my
skills.

## My Journey

My journey into programming began when I was a sophomore in electronic commerce. During that time, I started learning
HTML and became interested in web development. After graduating, I initially pursued a career in internet marketing and
spent two years in that field.

It was during my work in internet marketing that I discovered my true passion for programming. I became fascinated with
the idea of developing automation tools and scraping information from the web. Realizing that I wanted to pursue a
career in software development, I decided to take a break from my job and dedicate myself to learning programming.

For the next year, I taught myself Python and various other technical skills, including Linux, Vim, principles of
computer composition, computer networking, algorithms and data structures, and operating systems. My hard work paid off,
and in 2016, I started working as a Python programmer.

Since then, my passion for programming has only grown. In addition to Python, I have taught myself Go, Rust, and
TypeScript. I've worked on numerous projects, continuously striving to improve my skills and expand my knowledge.

Today, I continue to explore new technologies and programming languages, seeking not only to grow as a software
developer but also to contribute meaningfully to the broader tech community. My long-term goal is to inspire and empower
others on their coding journeys, just as I have been inspired and empowered on mine.
