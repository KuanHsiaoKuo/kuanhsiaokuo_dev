# Introduction

## Welcome to KuanHsiaokuo's Developer Space!

Greetings and welcome! I'm known online as **KuanHsiaokuo**, a name deeply meaningful to me, inspired by the profound
wisdom of _The Book of Changes (I Ching)_.

![kuan hexagram](img/kuan.png)

The name **Kuan** corresponds to the 20th hexagram, "观" (Guān), symbolizing contemplation, observation, and insight. In
programming, observation and contemplation are critical skills that enable us to understand problems deeply and find
elegant and efficient solutions. In life, it encourages us to pay more attention to details and to understand the needs
and thoughts of others more profoundly.

**Hsiaokuo** represents the 62nd hexagram, "小过" (Xiǎo Guò), emphasizing the importance of small actions and the
significance of minor matters. In coding, it means focusing on the details of the code, continuously improving, and
refining incrementally. In life, it reminds us that even small changes can have a huge impact, deserving our attention
and care.

I have incorporated the wisdom of these hexagrams into my internet identity and also infused their philosophies into my
digital space. Here, you'll find a collection of my thoughts and practices on programming, including experiences and
works in Python, Rust, Go, TypeScript, and Shell scripting.

Based on the thoughts of **kuan** and **hsiaokuo**, I encourage you to:

1. **Practice Observation:** Take time to carefully observe and understand the problems you're working on. This can lead
   to deeper insights and more effective solutions.
2. **Focus on Details:** Pay attention to the small details in your code. Even tiny improvements can lead to better
   performance, readability, and maintainability.
3. **Refine Incrementally:** Continuously improve and refine your code. Consistent, incremental progress can lead to
   significant long-term gains.
4. **Learn from Others:** Observe and learn from the work of other developers. This can offer new perspectives and
   techniques to enhance your skills.

Whether you're a fellow developer looking for programming tips and inspiration, or a recruiter seeking my skills, I
invite you to explore my site. I hope you find something valuable here, and may the ancient wisdom guide us on our
journeys in coding and life!

## My Journey

My journey into programming began when I was a sophomore in electronic commerce. During that time, I started learning
HTML and became interested in web development. After graduating, I initially pursued a career in internet marketing and
spent two years in that field.

It was during my work in internet marketing that I discovered my true passion for programming. I became fascinated with
the idea of developing automation tools and scraping information from the web. Realizing that I wanted to pursue a
career in software development, I decided to take a break from my job and dedicate myself to learning programming.

For the next year, I taught myself Python and various other technical skills, including Linux, Vim, principles of
computer composition, computer networking, algorithms and data structures, and operating systems. My hard work paid off,
and in 2016, I started working as a Python programmer.

Since then, my passion for programming has only grown. In addition to Python, I have taught myself Go, Rust, and
TypeScript. I've worked on numerous projects, continuously striving to improve my skills and expand my knowledge.

Today, I continue to explore new technologies and programming languages, seeking not only to grow as a software
developer but also to contribute meaningfully to the broader tech community. My long-term goal is to inspire and empower
others on their coding journeys, just as I have been inspired and empowered on mine

**Best regards,**
